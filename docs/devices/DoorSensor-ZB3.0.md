## Setup

### Factory Reset

Factory reset the sensor by holding the small rear button for 10 seconds. The LED will blink quickly in red for this duration, then go solid for three seconds, indicating a reset.

### Pairing

Short press the small rear button three times. If the device is not in the network, the LED will blink slowly in orange then attempt to join an available network. If the device is already in the network, the LED will blink green for five seconds - a factory reset is needed to pair to a new network.

| Blink | Green | 7 secs | Power on |
| Blink | Orange | - | Pairing (timeout: 2 mins) |
| Solid | Green | - | Pairing successful |
| Solid | Orange | 3 secs | Pairing failed |
